<h2 style="color:IndianRed;">Reporting a Vulnerability</h2>

If you have found a security vulnerability in *Wordhoard*, or a dependency use, please contact us on [Slack](https://wordhoardsupport.slack.com) or via email me at [Wordhoard project](mailto:wordhoardproject@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20wordhoard%20project%20security%20issue).

Please join the `#wordhoard-project` channel and say that you believe you have found a security issue. 
One of the Wordhoard Support members will send you a direct message to understand the problem. Once the problem is understood a newly created private channel
will be created by the Member and you will be invited to explain the problem further.

Please provide a [concise reproducible test case](http://sscce.org/) and describe what results you are seeing and what results you expect.
