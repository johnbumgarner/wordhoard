<p align="justify">
The majority of the sources that <strong>WordHoard</strong> queries are primarily in the English language. To find antonyms, synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms and homophones for other languages <strong>WordHoard</strong> has 3 embedded translation modules. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
These modules are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://translate.google.com">Google Translate</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL Translate</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://mymemory.translated.net">MyMemory Translate</a></li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
It is worth noting that none of the translation services are perfect, thus it can make <i>“lost in translation”</i> mistakes. These mistakes are usually related to the translation service not having an in-depth understanding of the language or not being able to under the context of these words being translated.  In some cases there will be nonsensical literal translations.  So any translations should be reviewed for these common mistakes.
